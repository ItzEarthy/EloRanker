# Elo Ranking System for Pool Matches

Welcome to the Elo Ranking System for Pool Matches! Track and manage your pool game rankings effortlessly with our custom-built Elo Ranking System. Whether you’re competing in singles or doubles, this tool accurately calculates rankings based on match results and performance. Here’s how it works:

## About the Elo Rating System
The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitive games. Each player starts with a base rating, and their rating goes up or down based on the outcome of matches. Players earn points by winning games, while losses decrease their rating. This allows for fair and continuous ranking adjustments based on real-time performance.

## History
This started off as a Python script for manually inputting all data after one of your Billards Club Meetings. I developed the site to offer a more dynamic atmosphere for the players and spectators. The site has received positive feedback from our users.

## Match Types: Singles & Doubles
Our system supports both singles and doubles matches:

- **Singles:** In singles, one player competes against another. Rankings are adjusted using a standard Elo formula to reflect the player’s skill and recent match history.
- **Doubles:** In doubles, two teams of two players each compete against each other. A separate Elo calculation with adjusted values is used to track team-based performance.

## How It Works
To submit your match result, simply enter the names of players, specify the match type, and indicate the winner. The Elo system will automatically update each player’s ranking based on the outcome. Toggle between singles and doubles to easily switch between formats!
